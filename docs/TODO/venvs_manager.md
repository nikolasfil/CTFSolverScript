## Venvs manager 

- Add a global directory that Venvs will be saved.
- For every venv that I want to create, save a shortcut inside the current folder 
- Everytime that I want to activate the venv, it will look for the shortcut inside the folder I am, and copy the activation command 
- make it linux and windows friendly 
- venv cleaner : 
    - will go in a directory 
    - figure out which folder is a venv 
    - activate the venv 
    - save the requirements and the pipdeptree of the venv in a file inside the folder
    - Option to transfer the venv to the global directory 
    - Option to delete the venv
