## Color printing

- add packet to print prettier the results

## Environment

- Ideally a textual editor that has the controls in the side

## Functionality

- add a list of files that can be considered part of the challenge for easier approach
- add more folders to the standardization
- rethink the way bashcommands are used
- recheck the code
- tree the folders to get the names. Makeshift Database for the challenges.
- Also try to correlate the Obsidian Writeups with the Makeshift database
- Add a way to check if there are challenges that don't have the proper folder structure

## Publish in pip ?

## Automated solver

- ~Automate the sphynx api documentation ( perhaps a git precommit )~

## Refactor the bash shortcut

- change the way the bash shortcuts are called
- find a way to add bash autocompletion to the venv

## Documentation

Add the documentation on the commands to run and how the whole package is meant to be used

## Discerning libraries

- add a template for every other library used for the solver

## Challenges

- Incorporate : `/home/figaro/CTF/Categories/Forensics/ctflearn/HailCeasar` into the solver
- Find every other challenge that has a solution.py and add it
- In every folder that has a solution include the original function of the solution

- Make a function that finds all the helpers that have more than the original CTFSolver function !!!

- Add a print function that iterates with a for loop if it is given a tuple, list, set or dict. Automatically turns them into strings if they are not


## Automation 

- automatic cd to predefined folder, and cdir to new challenges
