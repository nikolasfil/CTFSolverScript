Module ctfsolver.managers.manager_folder
========================================
manager_folder.py

This module provides the `ManagerFolder` class for managing folder structures and file operations
in the context of CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. It offers utilities for initializing challenge
folders, preparing and cleaning up files, searching for patterns, and introspecting Python files
for function definitions.

Classes:
    ManagerFolder: Handles creation, management, and introspection of challenge-related folders and files.

Typical usage example:
    manager = ManagerFolder(file="challenge.py", verbose=True)
    manager.create_parent_folder()
    manager.prepare_space(files=["input.txt", "output.txt"])
    functions = manager.get_functions_from_file("challenge.py")

    CONFIG (dict): Global configuration dictionary imported from ctfsolver.config.
