Module ctfsolver.managers.manager_connections
=============================================
manager_connections.py

This module provides the ManagerConnections class for managing connections to CTF challenges,
supporting both local and remote connection types using the pwntools library.

Classes:
    ManagerConnections: Handles connection setup, interaction, and communication with CTF challenges.

Typical usage example:
    manager = ManagerConnections(url="example.com", port=1337, conn="remote")
    manager.initiate_connection()
    output = manager.recv_lines(number=3, display=True, save=True)
    manager.send_menu(choice=1, menu_num=3, menu_text="Your choice:")

Attributes:
    pwn (module): Reference to the pwntools library.
    url (str): Remote URL for connection.
    port (int): Remote port for connection.
    conn_type (str): Type of connection ("local" or "remote").
    conn: Active connection object.
    menu_num (int): Number of menu options.
    menu_text (str): Text prompt for menu selection.
    debug (bool): Debug mode flag.

    ValueError: If required menu parameters are not provided.
    DeprecationWarning: If deprecated methods are used.
    EOFError: If the connection closes unexpectedly during data reception.

`ManagerConnections(*args, **kwargs)`
:   Manages connections to CTF challenges, supporting both local and remote modes.
    This class provides methods to initiate and manage connections to CTF challenges,
    either by spawning a local process or connecting to a remote host. It also offers
    utilities for interacting with typical menu-driven CTF binaries, including sending
    choices, receiving lines, and handling menu prompts.
    Attributes:
        pwn: The pwntools module or object used for process and remote connections.
        url (str): The remote host URL or IP address.
        port (int): The remote host port.
        conn_type (str): Type of connection, either 'local' or 'remote'.
        conn: The active connection object (process or remote).
        menu_num (int): Number of menu options expected.
        menu_text (str): Text prompt expected before sending a menu choice.
