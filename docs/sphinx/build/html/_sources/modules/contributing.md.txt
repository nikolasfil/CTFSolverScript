# Contributing

Not even I know what I am doing.
If you want to help, awesome, shoot me a message for more info.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main` or `development`.
2. **Make your changes** with VERY clear commit messages.
3. **Test your code** to ensure stability. ( Something I myself will do in the next version)
4. **Submit a pull request** describing your contribution.

## Guidelines

- To add a new functionality to be inhereted, add a new manager
- To add a new functionality for the inline tool add new folders
- Document your code and changes.

I **appreciate** your help in making this project better!
