# Welcome to ctfsolver Documentation 2

:::{note}
This library has been created to suit my needs.
:::

What I mean is, I was developing it when I was solving CTF challenges.
By solving the ctf's with python, and automating the solutions, I collected many scripts.

Some functionalities came by request, some I implemented out of personal interest.

Some things will seem weird to others, such as the structure of the challenge folder, and the keywords used.

:::{tip}
Use editable mode during development:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

:::

## Quick Start 2

```python
from ctfsolver.managers import manager_crypto
result = manager_crypto.encrypt_caesar("HELLO", shift=3)
print(result)  # 'KHOOR'
```

## Code Block with Line Numbers 2

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
from ctfsolver.inline import inline_tool
inline_tool.run()
```

## Admonitions 2
