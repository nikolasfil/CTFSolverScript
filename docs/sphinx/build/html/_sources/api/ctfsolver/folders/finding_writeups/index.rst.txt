   - Clean up writeup data by filtering out unwanted files and folders.
   - Normalize challenge and writeup names for comparison.
   - Find differences between available challenges and writeups.
   - Print formatted tables summarizing challenges, writeups, and their differences.

   .. attribute:: Inherits from CTFSolver, which should provide methods like single_folder_search and Path.

      

   .. method:: printing_table(challenges)

      
      Prints a formatted table of challenges grouped by category and site.
      

   .. method:: printing_table_diff(challenges)

      
      Prints a formatted table showing differences between challenges and writeups, including their source.
      

   .. method:: getting_challenges(path=None, folder=True)

      
      Retrieves a nested dictionary of challenges or writeups from the specified directory path.
      

   .. method:: writeup_cleanup(writeups, exclude=None)

      
      Cleans up the writeups dictionary by removing excluded categories and filtering out non-writeup files.
      

   .. method:: lowering(challenges)

      
      Normalizes challenge names by removing punctuation, spaces, and converting to lowercase.
      

   .. method:: differ(challenges, writeups)

      
      Compares challenges and writeups, returning a dictionary of differences by category and site.
      

   .. method:: main()

      
      Main workflow to retrieve challenges and writeups, clean and compare them, and print the results.
      
      


   .. py:method:: printing_table(challenges)

      Prints a formatted table displaying CTF challenges grouped by category and site.
      :param challenges: A nested dictionary where the first-level keys are category names (str),
      :type challenges: dict
      :param the second-level keys are site names:
