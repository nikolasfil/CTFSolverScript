# Welcome to ctfsolver Documentation

:::{note}
This library has been created to suit my needs.
:::

What I mean is, I was developing it when I was solving CTF challenges.
By solving the ctf's with python, and automating the solutions, I collected many scripts.

Some functionalities came by request, some I implemented out of personal interest.

Some things will seem weird to others, such as the structure of the challenge folder, and the keywords used.

:::{warning}

The documentation is still under development
