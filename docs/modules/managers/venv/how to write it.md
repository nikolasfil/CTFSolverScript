- First of all we need to have the challenge information in the folder 
	- Run the command `ctfsolver challenge init`
		- this should fill the information from the directory 
		- this should fill the information from the writeup ( linker module )
- check if the challenge has a venv 
	- run the command `ctfsolver venv move`
		- find the venv 
		- get the pipdeptree info 
		- write them to the challenge information json 
		- retrieve the name of the venv from the challenge information json 
			- if the name does not exist 
				- write the challenge name. It will not contain the full path, as it gets the venvs_path from the global config 
		- create the venv in the venvs_path 
		- install the pipdeptree info 
		- remove the local venv
