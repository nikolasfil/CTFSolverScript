"""
Global configuration management for the CTFSolverScript package.

This module provides the `GlobalConfig` class, which handles the creation, initialization,
and access of a global configuration file stored in the user's home directory. The configuration
file is used to store persistent settings required by the CTFSolverScript inline tool.

Classes:
    GlobalConfig: Manages the global configuration file, including creation, initialization,
                  reading, and attribute/dictionary-style access to configuration values.

Attributes:
    CONFIG (GlobalConfig): Singleton instance of the GlobalConfig class for global access.

Example:
    >>> from ctfsolver.config.global_config import CONFIG
    >>> from ctfsolver.config import CONFIG
    >>> CONFIG.initializing()  # Initializes the global configuration

Typical usage involves initializing the configuration (creating the file and writing initial
content if necessary) and accessing configuration values via attribute or dictionary-style access.

Raises:
    AttributeError: If an attribute is accessed that does not exist in the configuration.
    KeyError: If a key is accessed that does not exist in the configuration.
