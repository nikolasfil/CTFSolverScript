manager_file.py

This module defines the ManagerFile class, which serves as a unified interface for file and folder management operations within the CTF solver application. It inherits functionality from ManagerFilePcap, ManagerFileRegex, and ManagerFolder, enabling support for pcap file handling, regex-based file searches, and folder management.

Classes:
    ManagerFile: Combines methods from multiple manager classes to provide comprehensive file and folder operations, including searching for base64-encoded strings within files.

Usage:
    Instantiate ManagerFile to access file and folder management utilities, such as searching for patterns or handling specific file types.

Note:
    Some methods are deprecated and may be replaced by more specific implementations.

    ManagerFile class for handling file operations in CTF solving context.

    Methods:
        __init__(*args, **kwargs):
            Initializes the ManagerFile instance and its relevant ancestors.

            Initializes ManagerFolder and ManagerFilePcap ancestors.
        search_for_base64(file, *args, **kwargs):
            Deprecated. Use search_for_base64_file instead.
        search_for_base64_file(file, *args, **kwargs):
            Searches for base64 strings in the specified file.
                file (str): Path to the file to search.
                display (bool, optional): If True, prints the output. Defaults to False.
                save (bool, optional): If True, returns the output as a list. Defaults to False.
                strict (bool, optional): If True, applies strict matching. Defaults to False.
                list: List of matched base64 strings if save is True; otherwise, None.
